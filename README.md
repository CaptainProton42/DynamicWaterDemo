## Running

You can find a browser compatible demo and explanation of the implementation here: https://captainproton42.github.io/DynamicWaterDemo/.

This repository can also be cloned (see below) and the scene run from the editor.

## Cloning

Use

```
git clone --single-branch https://github.com/CaptainProton42/DynamicWaterDemo
```

to clone only the master branch without the media used for the explanation page.
